        <h2>About ThootTrack</h2>
        <p>ThootTrack is a cutting-edge application designed to support small dental clinics seeking to transition from traditional methods or Excel-based systems. As a dental professional pursuing my Doctorate in Dental Medicine, I drew inspiration from my own experiences and those of my colleagues who are still relying on outdated practices in their clinics. By consolidating insights from these professionals, I aimed to create a solution that addresses the specific needs of dental clinics and enhances their operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>The current features of ThootTrack are intentionally basic and global, serving as a foundation to represent the overall concept of the application. They include user management, patient management, appointment scheduling, and report generation. While these features provide a solid starting point, we envision a more comprehensive platform with additional features and functionalities to be developed over time. Our goal is to continually refine and expand ThootTrack to meet the evolving needs of dental clinics, ultimately improving the quality of care and patient experience.</p>
        <p>This project is a part of my Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton School</a>.</p>
